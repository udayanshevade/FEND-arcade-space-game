===============================

Instructions on opening the game:
  1. Open the index.html file in a browser and presto.
  2. Click to move and hold click to move fluidly. Double click to warp.
    2.5. Both you and all asteroids can warp. Pro-tip: don't warp side by side.
  3. Avoid asteroids. If one hits you don't worry bout it. Health regenerates.
  4. Rack up those long distances while conserving health.
  5. Sight-see the universe.
  6. Hopefully feel relaxed/have fun! :)

Downstream bugs will be fixed in time, as the game will be developed further.
